# 15663-Computational-Photography-Assignment2

All questions were first done on jupyter-notebook and then transferred to python files. Please look at the corresponding pdf-printouts as well to see outputs as expected. 

Please look at code and report together as they are complementary.

=============

hw2.py == hw2.ipynb => Corresponds to Parts 1 through 3 of the hw.

hw2-my-hdr-stack.py == hw2-my-hdr-stack.ipynb => Corresponds to Parts 4a and 4b (2 different custom hdr stacks).

Noise-Calibration.py == Noise-Calibration.ipynb => Corresponds to Part5

=============

Folder outputs has all required HDRs labelled with their corresponding parts.

All numpy files saved are loaded up.
